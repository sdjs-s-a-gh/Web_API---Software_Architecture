## Description
A private, backend web API based on RESTful principles to act as an information resource on the internet, managing data about an academic conference. This has been created for the Software Architecture
coursework using the dataset about the CHI 2023 conference held in Hamburg, Germany. The dataset provided information about content that was presented at the conference -- including details like
their title, authors, DOI links and potential awards to name a few.

Designed to be used in frontend applications, this API allows clients to request various information about the conference - with clients able to both access and modify the database.
